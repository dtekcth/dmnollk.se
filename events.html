  <h2>WELCOME EVENT</h2>
  <main></br>
    August 29th</br>
    Free event</br>
    No signup</br>
    17:17 at Deltaparken</br>
    </br>
    During your first day you will get a lot of information about your Master's program and the courses you will have. Take the chance to restore your brain and just relax and hang out with some of your new classmates at the Delta Park after your first classes. The park is located just outside of Basen, the place where you as a student of the computer division, will have access to and is always welcome to study or use our microwaves and kitchen.
    While you bask in the dubious sun getting to know one another, DMNollK will be handing out some juicy food (vegan choice available) and beverages. Moreover, we will have a quiz walk / treasure hunt to show you the campus and introduce you to some of the other committees at our department.

    Bad weather? Yes, no? Who cares when you can take outside inside! Look for the big oxidized copper dome on the edge of campus and join us for some climbing. Beginner or pro, come as you are!
    Prepare to get a bit sweaty, so grab your workout clothes if you have any. They have a limited number of climbing shoes available to borrow, so bring climbing shoes if you have any, otherwise any normal indoor-gym shoes would also work. There are changing rooms and showers for those who wishes. 
    Come join us in an evening of walls, sweat and tears.

    A crayfish party is a classic Swedish tradition, taking place during late summer. You don't want to start your second week as a master's student without singing hilarious songs while trying to figure out how to eat the delicious, red, crazy looking shellfish!
    Crayfish is the main star of this evening but you will also be served side dishes along with a nice sip of traditional Swedish snaps that goes down well with the the food! Of course there will be a vegan alternative too, so make sure to be there either way! 
    This is the sittning with the big S. Get a ticket as soon as possible as there are only a limited amount!
