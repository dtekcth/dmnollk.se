  <h2>FIRST DAY WELCOME EVENT</h2>
  <main></br>
    September 2nd</br>
    Free event</br>
    No signup</br>
    12:12 at Deltaparken</br>
    </br>
    During your first day you will get a lot of information about your Master’s 
    program and the courses you will have. Take the chance to restore your brain 
    and just relax and hang out with some of your new classmates at the Delta Park 
    after your first classes. The park is located just outside of Basen, the place 
    where you as a student of the computer division, will have access to and is always 
    welcome to study or use our microwaves and kitchen.
    </br>
    </br>
    While you bask in the dubious sun getting to know one another, DMNollK will be 
    handing out some juicy food (vegan choice available) and beverages. Moreover, 
    we will have a walk around campus and you will get an introduction to some of 
    the many committees at the division of computer science and engineering.

    As certified computer nerds it is important to remember that even though the

    outside. To help you out we have prepared an evening at the discgolf course 
    in slottsskogen. 
    </br>
    Discs will be available but you are welcome to bring your own if you have 
    them. There will be happy walking in the forest, incredible throws that 
    leave you speechless and awful throws that leave you equally speechless.
    </br>
    It will be a lot of fun and we hope to see you there. Remember to bring 
    appropriate clothes for the weather and comfortable shoes to walk in.
