  <h2>FIRST DAY WELCOME EVENT</h2>
  <main></br>
    August 28th</br>
    Free event</br>
    No signup</br>
    17:17 at Deltaparken</br>
    </br>
    During your first day you will get a lot of information about your Master’s program and the courses you will have. Take the chance to restore your brain and just relax and hang out with some of your new classmates at the Delta Park after your first classes. The park is located just outside of Basen, the place where you as a student of the computer division, will have access to and is always welcome to study or use our microwaves and kitchen.
    </br>
    </br>
    While you bask in the dubious sun getting to know one another, DMNollK will be handing out some juicy food (vegan choice available) and beverages. Moreover, we will have a walk around campus and you will get an introduction to some of the many committees at the division of computer science and engineering.

    </br>
    As certified computer nerds it is important to remember that even though the internet is a (sometimes) wontefull place it is important to spend some time outside. To help you out we have prepared an evening at the discgolf course in slottsskogen. 
    </br>
    Discs will be available but you are welcome to bring your own if you have them. There will be happy walking in the forest, incredible throws that leave you speechless and awful throws that leave you equally speechless.
    </br>
    It will be a lot of fun and we hope to see you there. Remember to bring appropriate clothes for the weather and comfortable shoes to walk in.

    A crayfish party is a classic Swedish tradition, taking place during late summer. You don't want to start your second week as a master's student without singing hilarious songs while trying to figure out how to eat the delicious, red, crazy looking shellfish!
    Crayfish is the main star of this evening but you will also be served side dishes along with a nice sip of traditional Swedish snaps that goes down well with the the food! Of course there will be a vegan alternative too, so make sure to be there either way! 
    This is the sittning with the big S. Get a ticket as soon as possible as there are only a limited amount!
