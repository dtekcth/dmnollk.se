      <h2>Buying second hand books</h2>
      <p>
        The CSE division has its own Facebook group for selling and buying course literature one doesn't need
        anymore. You can find lots of books there! The group is called
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/124679904351930/">
          Bokbytargrupp för data
        </a>

        Bonus: the cost for renting is really low, especially for members of the division, i.e. if you study the
        bachelor program for Computer Science, MPALG, MPCSN or MPHPC! You find more information about renting it

      <p>
        All students at the CSE division are welcome to attend the division meetings where lots of important
        decisions affecting all the divsion's students are taken. Information from the Student Union is also given.
        The meetings are held by the committee Talhenspresidiet. Free food and 'fika' are available during the meeting
        and usually there is a lottery as well where someone at the meeting wins a cool thing!
        The meetings are held at the Thursday in study week 6 every study period plus a few extra times a year.
