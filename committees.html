      <h2>Committees at Chalmers</h2>
      <p>
        There are lots of committees at Chalmers in the Student Union as well as
        at the CSE division! There are committees for many, many different interests,
        like for example dancing, singing, playing football, arranging parties or pubs
        or taking care of the division's rooms. If you can't find a committee for what
        you are interested in, you can also create your own! Check out the current committees
        at the division in the different submenus for committees above.

      <h2>Interested in joining a division committee?</h2>
      <p>
        Awesome! Every year the committees changes who is in the committee and
        before that (almost) all committees have a so called 'aspning'. This is
        an opportunity to find out more about the committees and what they are doing
        and at the same time getting to know other students who are also interested
        in joining. It is also totally fine to attend the 'aspning' also without
        applying for the committee. Most committees starts their 'aspning' in January,
        but a few has it already during the autumn, depending on when applications
        for the respective committee is to be made. Contact the committee you are
        interested in if you want to know when they start recruiting! Applications
        is generally done at division meetings.

      <h2>Interested in joining a committee at the Student Union?</h2>
      <p>
        That's great! To find out more about the committee and when its
        'aspning' is, contact the committee you are interested in. 'Aspning'
        is an opportunity to find out more about the committees and what they are doing
        and at the same time getting to know other students who are also interested
        in joining. It is also totally fine to attend the 'aspning' also without
        applying for the committee. A list of committees at the Student Union can be
        found

      <h2>Are you missing a committee?</h2>
      <p>
        Doesn't there seem to be a committee at the division or Student Union for what
        you are interested in? Then start the committee yourself! If you want to start a
        committee at the division, you need to send in a paper describing the committee
        and its purpose to the committee Talhenspresidiet and to the divsion board (see emails
        in the committee list). If you want to start it at the Student Union contact the
        <a href="https://chalmersstudentkar.se/management-team/">
          Student Union management team
        </a>
        to find out how.
