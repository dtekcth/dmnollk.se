# DMNollK-webpage
Things that should be updated on the webpage each year:
- the home page by removing old news and adding new ones
- the module by removing the old module-file and adding the new one
- updating the years on all pages so that it matches the current year
- update the pictures for those committees that have year-specific logos
- update the banner-image (the picture of DMNollK) and the pictures of all members in DMNollK, as well as the names in the descriptions of all members

Note: if you keep the same names for the pictures files as the previous ones, it is enough to just replace the files and no changes in the code has to be made for this.
Also make sure to get pictures without a background color for the committee logos to make it look better.

Remark: to be able to test the webpage and see the footer, you need to start a local server. When something on the webpage is updated, make sure to contact dHack so that they
can upload the new version of the webpage to the domain.
