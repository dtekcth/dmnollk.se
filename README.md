Things that should be updated on the webpage each year:
- Module.pdf

- image_header.png
- image_logo.png
- events.html
- links in index.html
- make sure its the correct schedule, facebook, instagram, email, and all links in studies.html
(keep the same names of ex images so you dont have to change the code)

When something on the webpage is updated, make sure to push and contact dHack so that they can upload the new version of the webpage to the domain!

Remark: 
start a local server to test webpage, ex:
